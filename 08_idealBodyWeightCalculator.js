/**
 * 1. Ideal Body Weight Calculator
 *    - Create a JavaScript program that calculates a person’s ideal body weight based on their height and gender.
 *    - Use the following formula:
 *      - For males: Ideal weight = 50 + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet.
 *      - For females: Ideal weight = 45.5 + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet.
 *    - Determine if the user’s current weight is within 10% of the ideal weight. 
 *      - If it is, output "Healthy weight range".
 *      - Otherwise, output whether they are "Under ideal weight" or "Over ideal weight".
